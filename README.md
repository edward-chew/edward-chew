# Hello, world. 🚀
I'm a recent computer science grad from UC Davis, and am currently based in the SF Bay Area. Through side projects, coursework, and involvements, I’ve explored domains well beyond coding. I really enjoy UX design and business/entrepreneurship, as it’s helped me understand a software product end-to-end. For now, I’m especially interested in pursuing front-end development, as it blends my coding and design interests. As I start my career, I hope to get involved with an even greater variety of fields in and out of computer science.

## Past Work to Highlight ✨
- **[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en)** I automated a large suite of end-to-end UI tests on several Db2 database management interfaces.
- **[CodeLab](https://www.codelabdavis.com/)** I co-founded and was President of one of the largest software development and UX design organizations at UC Davis. In my three years leading the organization, we completed 24 projects, worked with 15 tech startup clients, and had over 180 members.
- **[Hands Together](https://www.handstogether-sa.org/)** I worked with a 6-person development team to build a MERN stack website for a Santa Ana-based early childhood education nonprofit.
- **[Komma](https://edwardchew.vercel.app/komma-meetings)** I co-founded and led the product development of a software startup automating the meeting scheduling process. We participated in PLASMA 2021, the UC Davis startup accelerator.
- **[Computational Communication Lab](https://c2.ucdavis.edu/)** I worked on a project examining Google Translate's effectiveness in retaining semantic content in Tweets. The manuscript was accepted to the 72nd [International Communication Association](https://www.icahdq.org/) conference.

## Some Smaller Projects 🌱
- **[Interview Ace](https://github.com/edward-chew/interview-ace),** a GPT-4 powered interview preparation tool.
- **[Personal Website](https://www.edwardchew.me/),** a showcase of my past projects and experiences.
